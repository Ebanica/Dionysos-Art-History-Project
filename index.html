        How painting reflects the life of Dionysos in the Classical Period? In
        art, the Classical Period includes the Early Classical period (479-450
        BC), High Classical Period (450-425 BC), Period of the "Rich Style"
        (425-380 BC), and Late Classical Period (380-323 BC). The son of Zeus
        and the mortal Semele, Dionysos or Dionysus, is a nature God. The
        mythological story of Dionysos reveals that Semele was incinerated by
        the divine radiance of Zeus when he appeared to her. Zeus rescued his
        unborn Dionysos by "sewing him within his thigh" ("Hermes and the Infant
        Dionysos"). When Dionysos was born, Zeus ordered Hermes, his son, to
        hide the infant Dionysos from his wife, Hera, by taking him to the
        mountains to be raised by the nymphs. When Dionysos grew, he became the
        God of wine, pleasure, fertility, vegetation, and theater. In classical
        art, the representation of Dionysos shows remarkable changes in his
        appearance. Classical vase-painting emphasizes the life of Dionysos from
        his birth to a mature God.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The representation of Dionyse's birth is a common theme for painters in
        the Classical Period. According to Isler-Kerėnyi, the author of the book
        "Dionysos in Classical Athens," some paintings of Dionysos refer to the
        "motif of the infant Dionysos handed over by his father" (100). They
        emphasize "Dionysos' birth from the thigh of his father" (Isler- Kerėnyi
        100). The scene from the lekythos attributed to Alkimachos Painter
        (Figures 1a, b) unusually depicts the birth of Dionysos. While Zeus
        seats, and Hermes, a son of Zeus, waits "to carry Dionysos off to be
        raised by nymphs" ("Oil flask (lekythos) with the birth of Dionysos"),
        the head of Dionysos raises from the leg of his father, Zeus. The same scene appears

        Dinos Painter (Figure 2) thirty years later. In the painting, Zeus is
        sitting and holding his sway. Dionysos raises from the thigh of his
        father while he stretches out his arms "towards a figure about to
        receive him" (Isler-Kerėnyi 101).

        The vase-painting of the Classical Period shows different scenes of the
        infant Dionysos. The krater attributed to the Phiale Painter (Figure 3)
        shows Hermes, who brings the infant Dionysos to Papasilenos to keep him
        safe from Hera, who was "jealous over an illegitimate child fathered by
        Zeus" (O'Donnell 3). The painting has outlined figures, few colors, and
        some "three-dimensional effects of perspective and shading" (O'Donnell
        3), but the whole scene shows poor artistic development.

        The images on the painted vase in the Classical Period show Dionysos as
        a youthful God. Dionysos appears in the company of a woman who may be
        Ariadne, his Cretan princess, and his wife. Being a symbol of happiness,
        the mythical marriage of Dionysos with a mortal is subject in the
        painting of the Classical Period. A krater attributed to Dinos Painter
        (Figures 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e) located at Benaki Museum depicts the
        "ritual celebration" (Sabetai 138) of Dionysos' marriage. "The krater is
        important, for it highlights the complex relationship between late
        classical Dionysiac imagery and cultural values that find expression in
        the context of Dionysiac religiosities, such as bliss within the frame
        of the legitimate marriage, an institution highly valorized in the
        Periclean polis" (Sabetai 139).

        The focal point of the krater is Dionysos and Ariadne. Both Dionysos and
        Ariadne wear festive garments and wreaths, and they "are depicted at
        equal height, gazing into each other's eyes" (Sabetai 139). The
        composition shows symmetry, privacy, and harmony. They look into each
        other's eyes and show love and happiness. While the youthful Dionysos
        holds a kantharos in his right hand, Ariadne holds an ivy branch in her
        right hand.

        The bride Ariadne shows wealth and special bridal features as she starts
        a new life. All the women in the scene wear jewelry. Between Dionysos
        and Ariadne, there is Eros. Both Ariadne and Eros have the same colors
        to show the influence of Ariadne's love on Dionysos. The scene shows a
        satyr figure on the left side, Dionysos, who drinks, and Ariadne, who
        seems to identify her presence with Eros. In front of them, there is a
        big krater for wine, a tray with food, and food offerings. On the
        krater's reversal side (Figure 5 c) are the members of Dionysos'
        worshippers, who move towards the altar, above the handle of the krater
        (Figure 5 d). A woman who holds a thyrsus leads the Dionysos' worshipers
        towards the altar. A wreathed drum player and a satyr that wears a
        himation follow the draped woman. He salutes Dionysos and Ariadne while
        he dances and looks back towards them. "The divine symposion is
        suggested by the presentation of Dionysos as reclining banqueter, the
        satyr-pais, the food-bearer, as well as the vessels appropriate for
        drinking and for libations: the bridal Ariadne, Eros, and the love-gifts
        point to the couple’s happy marriage. This fusion of sympotic and
        erotic-nuptial elements appears in a sacred ambiance indicated by the
        altar and the door" (Sabetai 141). Dionysos facing Ariadne in an
        intimate space is a sacred scene where the feast seems to be usual to
        the Gods. The whole painting emphasizes their happy marriage. The door
        (Figure 5e) found near the handle of the krater suggests an intimate
        space. In the companion of women, Dionysos appears as a God of women. He
        seems to be surrounded by many women who are not of the same status.
        Only Ariadne seems to face Dionysos in the vase paintings.

        On a hydria located in Berlin (Figure 6), Dionysos appears to be
        reluctant in the companion of Ariadne, and Athena seems to take Theseus
        away from the scene. As Dionysos appears as a "paradigmatic husband" in
        art, his marriage with Ariadne "was considered the paradigm of an
        emotionally and sexually blissful marriage" (Moraw 235). The women who
        appear with Dionysos on vase paintings are not ordinary women as they
        appear in the presence of God and the satyrs who are mythological
        figures. The women in the vase painting may symbolize the union of Gods
        with humans. As they appear in ritual scenes near the God and the
        satyrs, the women may bring divinity to the rituals that seem to be a
        combination between natural and divinity.

        Towards the end of the Classical Period, Dionysos seems to be more and
        more accompanied by one or more satyrs that may suggest some religious
        influences. On a bell krater from about 440 - 430 BC attributed to
        Kleophon Painter (Figure 7), a satyr figure who carries a chair on his
        left shoulder and has an ivy branch in his right hand follows Dionysos.
        A woman that holds a torch and a thyrsus in her hands leads the
        procession. While she moves forward, "she looks back at the God"
        (Isler-Kerėnyi 138). Being between the two figures, Dionysos holds an
        ivy branch and a kantharos in his left hand. The satyr figure has an ivy
        branch in his right hand that seems to be like Dionysos' ivy branch. In
        the painting, the satyr figure appears as a servant of Dionysos as he
        carries the chair. As the ivy branches are the same, they may show
        Dionysos' closeness to the satyr figure. Also, Dionysos appears to be a
        servant of the woman who leads the procession.

        The God Dionysos seems to be familiar to the Greeks in the Classical
        Period as he appears on vase painting from his birth to his adult life.
        The vase painting of Classical art emphasizes the story of Dionysos
        through images showing Dionysos in different stages of his life. In
        Classical Art, the vase painting highlights the transformation of
        Dionysos during his life. The painters of Classical Art depict Dionysos
        as an infant, a child, a youthful, and an adult. Dionysos is the God of
        wine, the God of women, a nature God, a God of happiness and pleasure,
        and the God of the theatre. As the vase painting emphasizes Dionysos in
        the presence of the mortals rather than immortal, he seems to be the God
        of the citizens who associate the afterlife with eternal pleasure and
        feast. Dionysos' marriage with a mortal suggests the aspirations of
        Greeks in the Classical period to divinity and eternal life. Dionysos'
        marriage symbolizes a perfect human marriage as he appears in the vase
        painting in the presence of a woman who seems to be Ariadne. As Ariadne
        appears in the vase painting in the companion of Dionysos, she
        symbolizes the relationship between humans and God. The satyrs appear in
        the vase painting to dance and sing, and they may emphasize the
        symposium where the mortal males were meeting to discuss and drink. As a
        God of wine, Dionysos may symbolize death and rebirth.
